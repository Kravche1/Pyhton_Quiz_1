# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves data analysis using Python and Pandas library. The dataset used contains responses from a survey conducted among developers. The goal is to extract insights from the data, perform various operations like filtering, sorting, and statistical analysis, and visualize the results using graphs.

## Project Structure
- `data_analysis.py`: Python script containing the code for data analysis tasks.
- `dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the survey data.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## How it Works
1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: The project starts by loading the dataset using Pandas. Necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed.
2. **Data Extraction and Manipulation**: Relevant columns and rows are extracted from the dataset. Indexing is assigned to a specific column for easy access.
3. **Filtering and Sorting**: Data is filtered based on specific criteria, and sorting is done based on one or more parameters.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical functions such as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum are applied to the data.
5. **Visualization**: The project includes the creation of two different types of graphs (e.g., bar chart, line chart) to visualize the data insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed.
3. Run the `data_analysis.py` script.
4. View the output printed in the console and the generated graphs.
